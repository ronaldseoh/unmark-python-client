# unmark-python-client

`unmark-python-client` is a Python package for adding links to your [Unmark](https://link.iamblogger.net/4). I created this mainly to use it with [Pythonista](https://link.iamblogger.net/5) and [Shortcuts](https://link.iamblogger.net/6) app on iOS (So that I can add links while browsing web on my iPhone), but it should work just fine on any Python 3 interpreters. Please see `example.py` and `Add to Unmark.shortcut` for sample usage.
